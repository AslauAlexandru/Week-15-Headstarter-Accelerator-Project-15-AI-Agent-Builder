# Week 15 Headstarter Accelerator Project 15 AI Agent Builder
*I have done AI Agent chatbot in Google Colab, but not in the Sim Studio GitHub repo.*
*I have not done the challenge. I have integrated AI Agent with MCP (Model Context Protocol), but it doesn't work like I expected.*
## Project Statemant
Sim Studio is a powerful, user-friendly platform that allows developers and agents to build, test, and optimize agentic workflows. The company was founded by Waleed, an Ex-Amazon Software Engineer and Emir, who scaled a product to 300k users and built the first chain-of-thought LLM application. The company has been accepted into the latest YCombinator batch and has an up and coming developer community.

For this project, you will be working with the Sim Studio GitHub repo to build a chat interface on the platform where users can input additional context to the agent, add multimodal content such as images, and have the agent utilize MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers to perform actions.

**Getting Started:**

- Clone the Sim Studio GitHub repo here and follow the instructions in the README for running the repo locally
- Check out the Sim Studio docs here to learn about the different components in the workflow
- Learn about MCP servers here and check out a collection of MCP servers here

**Project Requirements:**

- Build an AI Agent chatbot tab on the Sim Studio platform that comprises of a chat interface instead of a workflow.

- Allow users to input additional context into the agent, add multimodal content, and have the agent utilize MCP (Model Context Protocol) to perform actions.

- Show users what tools & MCP servers are utilized by the agent with trace spans and clear observability.

- Challenge: Create a UI to accompany the chatbot that shows users what MCP servers / tools the agent is using in real time, similar to the workflow canvas.
